# Slingshot controller

Player controller made for Unity, that functions much like a slingshot. Pull back the anchor, and force will be applied to the player. In this instance, the player is the capsule pictured in the gif below.

Under the player script, adjust the `forceToAdd` variable to controll how far to shoot the player.
